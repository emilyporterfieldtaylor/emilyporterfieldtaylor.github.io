            One thing to know about me is I'm absolute shit at talking about myself. It makes me super uncomfortable and I'm never sure how to start.

            Starting with "My Name is Emily" feels way to cliche and boring. I could rip somebody else's intro and pull a "Hey! E Sauce here!" but I reall don't like that either. I guess I'll leave this grumbling as my intro. I'm just a lady trying to further her education since I'm not doing a damn thing with my Psycology degree. I've work in IT adjacent job or the past few years and I'm ready to actually do some real deep level shit.

            I recently moved to Austin but I've lived in the Austin area for the past 8 years. I have two kitties, Calcifer and Sofie, named after character from one of my favorite movies, Howl's Moving Castle. I try to spend as much time outside as my laziness will allow. I like to hunt for mushrooms or nice little shady spots to read and draw. I also really enjoy playing D&D and video games. Okay, well this has been very uncomfortable for me but I really enjoyed this prodject and I'm super excited to start learning frameworks!

            Cheers!
